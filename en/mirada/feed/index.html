<p>Architecture and resistance looks at spontaneous forms of construction, where structural logic is mixed with cultural inheritance. This architecture is free and represents a form of resistance to economic, social and political constraints. It also refers to traditional or vernacular construction that continues to be valid in spite of being forgotten or maligned.<br />
The investigation, localization and register of this type of constructions helps us to understand other ways of building, far-removed from grand architecture and urban planning, where the emphasis is on the creator’s resources and intentions. Buildings with a personal aesthetic that assert their existence and push us to look at, understand and assimilate them, breaking down an increasingly uniform and monumental vision of architecture.</p>

<p>Spanish Dream proposes a critical approach to the economic crisis and its consequences, referring to the American Dream as a symbol of identity of a country through its collective desire: to have home ownership in the Spanish case.<br />
This dream broke and, as legacy, we have an invaded country with unfinished buildings, premature ruins that are part of our landscape, like symbols of an individual and collective drama.<br />
Spanish Dream refers specially to the emotional, creating family scenes in unfinished buildings. The aspect is far from a domestic place and contrasts with the normally of the daily scenes, looking for a reflection about a society that, following the desire of becoming owners, forgot the real sense of inhabiting.</p>

<p>The economic crisis in Spain produced the cease and abandonment of aspiring and outstanding facilities conceived to fulfill amusement luxury during those happy years of wellbeing and abundance. The aspiring restoration of the old Balneario of Panticosa, located on the heart of the Spanish Pyrenees, and its transformation into a luxurious and modern tourist resort was suddenly vanished, producing for example the closure of the Gran Hotel designed by Rafael Moneo, the cessation of the construction —at its very ending stage— of the High-Performance Sports Center designed by Alvaro Siza or the abandonment of an impressive parking building anchored to the mountain. The images of this last facility selected for the Venice exhibition faithfully depict this sad reality and suggest a totally different visual narrative of the architectural space and its unexpected ruinous condition.</p>
<p>Panticosa, Huesca, Spain. December 2011 &#8211; November 2014</p>

<p>This is demolition journalism: breaking up with the previous, portraying new possibilities. Eight photographs show moments in the transformation, carried out by architects under 30, of several dwellings. Individually, each image freezes an instant of the process revealing an invisible reality; together, they reflect the work of this generation: refurbishments and renovations. In tune with the theme of the Biennale, the series implicitly defends destruction over construction, or refurbishing instead of building from scratch. Demolishing means breaking with a previous state that unveils the invisible qualities, and alters the original work plans. The photographs don’t show the finished objects but rather the processes that describe them and the virtues found in them. Faced with the uncertainty of the finished, the unknown comes to the fore, the fragility of the processes. The unfinished.</p>

<p>Photography was born with the purpose of capturing reality. It seems to fulfill this task: we think that what we see in this pictures is real. However, none of these spaces exist in the real world, or at least in the way they are shown here. Some have been digitally reconstructed from their own parts. In other ones, shinny elements of our everyday life have been inserted in decaying locations.<br />
But even if none of these had happened, these works would have never been able to reflect reality. The freezing of time, the flattening of three dimensions on two, the artitst aware decisions on the instant, composition, lens and any other technical elements of the photographic work, generate a specific, voluntary , fragmented and altered perception of reality.<br />
Therefore, to show this ambiguity, these photographs contain a metaphor about the device and photographic language.</p>

<p>Re-build, build on what already exists, pick a project and redo it from top to bottom. The intersection of two eras, two architects, two different construction techniques: an explosive encounter. A cross in the same space and time of destruction and construction, demolition and installation. The two worlds intermingle in a temporary chaos. The guts of the work, imperfect, brutal, complex, unpredictable, are scattered throughout the slit open building. New interventions overlap multiple layers that did not even know existed, forming a sandwich of the building’s history. An impure solutions catalog, gradually portions are removed, others sewed, capped, and in the end there are no traces of drastic intervention. Having seen the building inside shows his true inner beyond its final appearance.</p>

Flying over it at different years and different heights, stopping here and there along the way, in the last pages of this book you will be able to check the exact route of our trip. Before that, you are invited to walk the Nation as we have done for the past two years: without really knowing what we were seeing, in disbelief and amazement. We wondered at every step if it is true that when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into you.</p>
