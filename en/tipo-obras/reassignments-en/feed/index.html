<p>The site is 6.5 metres wide and very long, between two party walls, with access from two streets in the historic centre of Granollers. The existing construction was in a state of ruin; only the main street facade was preserved, as it was fairly sound and had certain historic value. The clients wanted to clearly differentiate two zones in the house: a domestic area for family life and a second area that could function independently, serving both as a more isolated and calm space as well as to receive guests or sporadically organize large communal meals. The sequence of spaces tries to create a certain ambiguity between interior and exterior, however, the exterior spaces are intentionally differentiated by more intensive vegetation and the use of unclad clay brick. The brick, with its more material and natural presence, creates a less domestic atmosphere and helps construct landscapes in this site without views. The organization of the materials and spaces tries to prioritize optimal passive behaviour, starting with the improved climate of the intermediate courtyards that reduces energy demand in the directly related spaces. .</p>

<p>In Building 8 B, a small building within the former slaughterhouse complex in Madrid, the clay roof tiles have been removed from a roof that needed to be replaced and stacked up inside of the space to solve a problem. Building 8 B is programmed to be an administrative space, with a small work space, a storage area and a multipurpose space for talks or presentations. It is a small building, but spatially very interesting. This intervention aims to respect a valid spatial configuration, with no adulteration. It is a test. This project retraces some paths that were taken, trying to find meeting points. The inert industrial elements are understood differently, decontextualized and installed with the unpredictability of manual labour. The tiles are used in another way. This project tries to understand architecture as an intellectual, cultural and ethical experience.</p>

<p>Gironella is a town that has grown in the past few decades divided by the Llobregat River. The historic centre is on the top a hill some 20 metres from the right bank of the river, while the modern part of the town is located on the other bank. This project proposes the insertion of an elevator to improve accessibility to the old town and promote the urban connection between the two parts of the town, encouraging the use of the historic centre and preventing the risk of social exclusion. The selection and placement of materials was determined by a set of criteria related to industrial buildings, economic concerns (low cost, ease of installation and zero maintenance), climatic considerations (sun protection for the elevator cab, ventilation of the shaft) and the possibility to create an entry for indirect light.</p>

<p>The cemetery is sited as the end to many unfinished processes in the city of Valencia; the end of the Avenida de Francia, the end of the interventions in the former riverbed and abutting with another city (that of Arts and Sciences). In this undefined space a simple intervention is made, both providing a finish for a constructed element, as well as giving it an identity and unity with the simple operation of installing a ceramic cladding in different tones of green.</p>

<p>The house occupies a corner site and is ordered in two directions. The house doesn’t have a dominant direction. The house looks in all directions. In order for the structural walls to dominate the space, the mechanical systems are located along the perimeter, creating a thick facade, freeing up the centre of the plan and permitting visual and program connections between the spaces. The materialization of these walls is a fundamental part of the project. There was an existing structure on the site built with bearing walls of marés, a local sandstone. Common sense led to the reuse these elements. The strategy was served. The stone gives the facade its texture and character; a texture that with the passing years will absorb a patina added by time. The old pieces of stone, due to their limited number, were combined with new pieces. The new ones came from the same quarry and were used at points were it was necessary to build more precise edges: window frames, roof copings, etc.</p>

<p>This main constraint of this project was the economic aspect; the design needed to be viable with a minimal budget (70.000 €). This factor limited structural possibilities, and finishes. This led to a clear premise: the architects would have to work with local craftsmen and fabricators (if possible from the same town), and use the technical solutions that they were accustomed to; traditional solutions adopted in the typical local construction. This led us work with load-bearing walls, one-way slabs, aluminium windows with reasonable dimensions and conventional finishes like painted stucco. The diaphanous space contains the living room, dining room and kitchen. This space is designed to maximize its area, so that the heart of the house and the space where the majority of daily functions take place is as pleasant as possible. The bedrooms, on the other hand, are basic spaces, with the minimum space required for sleeping and a small desk.</p>

<p>The habitat-storehouse is located in a rural area dedicated to livestock, vegetable gardens and fruit trees. The topography of the site defines the project’s position and basic geometry. The shed roof follows the slope of the ground, which naturalizes its integration into the surrounding site. The construction is placed between a pine forest to the north and existing terraces with olive, almond, fig and apricot trees to the south. The example of the nearby rabbit farm defines the habitat’s architectural language. The program consists of a multipurpose space: living/kitchen/bedroom/storeroom, a bathroom and a small bedroom. On the exterior there is a small outdoor storage space (west) and a paved area facing south.</p>

<p>Bilbao has a continuous ring of districts that surround the more touristic and mediatic city centre, many with evident necessities for architectural intervention. Matiko is one of them. In this district the city has provided an industrial building to be converted into an entrepreneurship centre, based on a model that uses the recovery of old buildings to revitalize the place where they are located. The most significant aspect of the project was the idea to design a facade that made the whole operation visible, with a minimal cost and maximum expressivity. The proposal is a uniform skin with a large scale that covers the exterior structure to create a taut plane. The material chosen for this facade is commonly used for mechanical installations, but here it is conferred with an aesthetic virtue: galvanized steel raceway pans. Behind this surface the old fascia panels and windows will be replaced with new ones that infill between the structural bays, increasing the amount of day lighting. The budget for the facade material (1 kilometre of pans) is around 10,000 € (28.40€m2), which can be considered strikingly low taking into account the impact of the image achieved by this operation.</p>
