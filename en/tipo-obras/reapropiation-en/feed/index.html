<p>Juan Domingo had decided that he would convert the old, abandoned factory near the train tracks into his architecture studio. A desire that became stronger with the passing years. The factory quickly became a field for study and experimentation where he learned the importance of addressing history and its meaning in a more natural, relaxed and less dramatic way. He reconstructed his history by letting intuition lead him and through a series of experiences which let him decipher this mysterious place, until he had made a map of singular events, from its foundation up to his arrival. He remembers having made outings to the site and naming different places, relating the original toponymy of the spaces with possible or desired future activities. With the passing years the revitalization project and the activities that have been implemented can be recognized as a rescue mission for this industrial complex. The short film ‘An encounter’, produced together with cinema director Juan Bollaín, relates his experiences in the factory.</p>

<p>This intervention interprets the building where the sixteenth-century convent is inserted, as a context that over the centuries is continually being transformed. Beyond a historical interest, the succession of alterations suggests a metamorphosis; the approach to the building emerges from the search for its materiality, concealed by the claddings of the old university classrooms.<br />
In this space that has been so dramatically altered, with an extremely limited budget, the project is activated by the action of discovery; converting destruction into something as natural as construction. After unmasking floors, walls and ceilings, the blurred openings between spaces were reinforced with steel jambs and lintels and new glazing was installed in the cloister to recover the transparent relation with the courtyard that existed when it was an ambulatory. The result is a rough intervention that doesn’t pretend to be conclusive, but offers an intermediate moment. From this point all options are possible; it is a space in an ellipsis, waiting expectantly for each artistic installation to complete it.</p>

<p>Acquired in 2004 in a state of ruin, over stages the old Barberí foundry has gradually become RCR Arquitectes’ studio. The past of this factory building, constructed at the beginning of the twentieth century, is evident everywhere and establishes a very close relationship with new interventions.<br />
The connection between tradition and innovation, together with other core concepts of the RCR philosophy like relating to the outdoors and reflecting the passage of time, has given rise to an ensemble that combines different spaces and uses.<br />
The renovation work, which has been under way since 2006, consolidated the former complex and reorganised the existing industrial buildings, transforming them into a laboratory that meets their studio’s various needs.</p>

<p>It was the notion of discovery that occurred with the Rei Marti water deposit, a former space for water storage of the Torre Bellesguard house in Barcelona, designed by Gaudi and located next to the viaduct that is also attributed to this totemic architect. This water deposit had been concealed beneath a pine forest until 20 years ago, when during some minor maintenance work on the small part of the old-growth forest that still remained; a truck began to sink into the ground. Quickly it was confirmed to the amazement of all that a huge space of more than 600 m2 was crouching under the earth. It was definitely decided to share the space, to invite the public to reclaim this stroke of luck, but, above all, share the emotion of the unexpected discovery. To this end the project had to be as faithful as possible to the space as it was originally encountered. The character, materiality, the force of a space with arches and vaults had to be valued, maintained and strengthened by the intervention.</p>

<p>After the former industrial shed was consolidated and suitably protected, and while construction still hadn’t started for the new MUHBA (Barcelona History Museum), it was decided that the complex would be opened to the public. First a minimum of strictly necessary construction had been carried out to protect the building from rain and wind: a new lightweight roof was built, supported on the existing structure, concrete paving was installed with an embedded raceway for future mechanical installation and the existing windows were protected with polycarbonate sheets. The objective of all the interventions was to affect as little as possible the interior atmosphere, in order to reflect the passage of time: the fire, the graffiti, etc. The design tried to define the intervention with a single gesture by proposing a huge lamp hung in the middle of the space, drawing a ring of light that separates the exterior perimeter, dedicated to housing a long term exhibition about the city of Barcelona, from the interior which is to house temporary exhibitions and presentations.</p>

<p>Renovation always implies establishing a certain relationship with the past, or with the pasts that are accumulated in the space of the intervention. This residential project for the members of an extended family has as its point of departure the recovery and renovation of a complex of derelict buildings constructed over the course of centuries in the historic centre of the city of Girona. The huge stone carcasses established an optimal relation to the place in climatic terms. The project tried to discover, maintain and revitalize the different forms of intelligence deposited in these spaces over time. In terms of materials, we were able to work with a valuable inheritance: the house itself provided grates, mosaic tile and stone that could be reused in the construction. The project casually reveals the overlapping of old and new layers, depending on the state of conservation of each element, and the future use of each space. And, above all, the growing confidence is a design system that is necessarily open (in this case the collage) capable of harmonically integrating into a whole all of the histories of each fragment of the process.</p>

<p>The Casa del Condestable is a sixteenth-century palace that had undergone sweeping renovations and alterations over the years, until finally the original building was unrecognizable and in a general state of ruin. The process of historical documentation, preparation of the design project and construction supervision of the building restoration and renovation lasted seven years. Original elements from the renaissance building were uncovered, including almost 4000 square meters of wood ceilings that had been hidden by suspended ceilings in the perimeter rooms. By removing the added ceilings and restoring the wood, these rooms recovered their original proportions and appearance. A major part of the architectural intervention centred around the recuperation of the central courtyard, of which only a few of the original columns remained. The project establishes a natural continuity between the old and the necessarily new, by using the original materials throughout: wood, terracotta, lime stuccoes and plaster.</p>

<p>The Casal Balaguer is a palace in the historic centre of Palma. It was a grand aristocratic house with its origins in the fourteenth-century, renovated in the sixteenth-century and enlarged in the eighteenth-century. At the end of the last century the City of Palma decided to convert the building into a cultural centre. The project signals a new era for the Casal, which will go from being a family home to a public building, open to the entire city. In the new program the ground floor contains the entry to the exhibition gallery and the cafeteria. The structural renovation on this floor made it possible to revert the courtyard to its the original condition, with a complete vision of the three arches that seem to support the suspended house. The main floor is dedicated to a museum about the house and the attic floor houses workshops for the fine arts circle and a lecture hall.</p>

<p>The former Bank of Spain in Santiago de Compostela was located in the plaza de Platerías and since its completion in 1949 had the dubious honour of being the most controversial building in the city. The construction of the new pilgrims’ museum by Manuel Gallego in the abandoned bank building succeeded in eliminating the negative energy that had always resided there. The need to conserve the stone facade didn’t impede the reorganization of the building complex, nor did the phrase “contemporary architecture as a new reference on the urban scene” as stated in the specific urban planning guidelines for the historic city centre. The new building is flexible and its visitor path is proposed as the continuation of the route of the Camino de Santiago, which culminates in a lookout from which to contemplate the Cathedral.</p>

<p>This complex was formed through a protracted transformation process during more than five hundred years that started with the existence of a Nasrid house, continued in the sixteenth-century with the construction of the “Admiral’s house” and was gradually added onto until the twentieth-century. Finally it was a monumental building, occupying an entire city block and overwhelming the small scale of its surroundings. The compound’s structure was adequate to house Granada’s new Architecture School; however an intervention was required to clarify the unity of the complex, not in a stylistic sense, but as an exercise in integration. In this heterogeneous composite there are elements that have specific architectural values together with others that have none. This intervention hopes that the tension generated between authentic elements from the past and new elements from the present will impregnate the rest in a way that helps the whole finally discover an architectural destiny. In this new phase the construction is the catalyzing agent of a new “whole”, recognizing the materiality of each era and the light as the basic integrating principles of the historic process.</p>
