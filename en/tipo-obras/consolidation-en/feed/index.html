<p>The old Convent of Santa Maria de los Reyes is located within a built-up block in the historic centre of Seville. It was abandoned and in a state of semi-ruin, except for the church, choirs and entry porch, which were used regularly for exhibitions and workshops. The old convent vegetable gardens had been converted into a large “vacant lot” concealed behind the walls of the old convent, waiting to be built on or rediscovered.<br />
Due to the decrepit state of the historical complex (cloister, cells, rectory and old vegetable gardens) an urgent intervention was required. Given the scarcity of available funding and taking into account the requirements of the new urban partners in the historic centre, it was decided to make installed consolidations; with new paths, consolidating urban practices and pre-inhabiting mechanisms for art installations.</p>

<p>The house at callejón de Menores 12 is a courtyard house with many elements of interest, dating from the first- through the twentieth-centuries. This project set out to establish innovative criteria for historic building renovation. The fundamental goal was to reactivate the residential fabric of the historic centre with new uses: generate new design methods for historic buildings, transmit knowledge to the participating students and define other approaches to renovation ranging from project management to actual construction, which could be exported as models for other situations in the city. Regarding the interventions, the first was to insure the stability of the structure by adding an exoskeleton that supports the existing structure, without removing anything. The intervention is accomplished while conserving the form and textures of the existing construction elements, maintaining the possibility to read each moment of the house’s history. Only reversible, dry-mounted construction systems are used.</p>

<p>The objective of this intervention was to restore the ruins of the old church without drastically changing its identity as a symbol and expression of the Battle of the Ebro, a turning point in the Spanish Civil War. It was vital that the transformation of the church into a multi-purpose hall be achieved without altering the memories it contained. The restoration called for the preservation of the subtle balance between nature and construction, exterior and interior, which is characteristic of all ruins. The perception that one is still “outside” even after entering “inside” had to be maintained. A transparent ETFE roof was installed, which prevents further deterioration of the building by atmospheric agents and notably improves interior comfort.<br />
The resulting space is halfway between inside and outside, thanks to the sunlight passing through the lightweight roof, the breeze, the sounds of the birds flying through the upper reaches of the aisles and the sand floors. </p>

<p>The time that passed from the eviction of the tenants of this sixteenth-century palace and the commission to transform the building into a small hotel and restaurant resulted in an extremely suggestive and evocative intermediate landscape; somewhere between a ruin and a void, between existing conditions and archaeology, a window open onto history in which the marks of events and of our time are superimposed, like a palimpsest. It is an atlas of different undocumented materials, which registers the memories of the inhabitants and the history of the construction of the house and its transformations.<br />
The intermediate house is a place waiting for something to happen. An intervened space without intervention. It is the frozen memory of a place that at this moment is not inhabited.<br />
Containing the past, present and future simultaneously as a way to retain in memory this place and its origin.</p>
