<p>The old Convent of Santa Maria de los Reyes is located within a built-up block in the historic centre of Seville. It was abandoned and in a state of semi-ruin, except for the church, choirs and entry porch, which were used regularly for exhibitions and workshops. The old convent vegetable gardens had been converted into a large “vacant lot” concealed behind the walls of the old convent, waiting to be built on or rediscovered.<br />
Due to the decrepit state of the historical complex (cloister, cells, rectory and old vegetable gardens) an urgent intervention was required. Given the scarcity of available funding and taking into account the requirements of the new urban partners in the historic centre, it was decided to make installed consolidations; with new paths, consolidating urban practices and pre-inhabiting mechanisms for art installations.</p>

<p>The house at callejón de Menores 12 is a courtyard house with many elements of interest, dating from the first- through the twentieth-centuries. This project set out to establish innovative criteria for historic building renovation. The fundamental goal was to reactivate the residential fabric of the historic centre with new uses: generate new design methods for historic buildings, transmit knowledge to the participating students and define other approaches to renovation ranging from project management to actual construction, which could be exported as models for other situations in the city. Regarding the interventions, the first was to insure the stability of the structure by adding an exoskeleton that supports the existing structure, without removing anything. The intervention is accomplished while conserving the form and textures of the existing construction elements, maintaining the possibility to read each moment of the house’s history. Only reversible, dry-mounted construction systems are used.</p>

<p>The objective of this intervention was to restore the ruins of the old church without drastically changing its identity as a symbol and expression of the Battle of the Ebro, a turning point in the Spanish Civil War. It was vital that the transformation of the church into a multi-purpose hall be achieved without altering the memories it contained. The restoration called for the preservation of the subtle balance between nature and construction, exterior and interior, which is characteristic of all ruins. The perception that one is still “outside” even after entering “inside” had to be maintained. A transparent ETFE roof was installed, which prevents further deterioration of the building by atmospheric agents and notably improves interior comfort.<br />
The resulting space is halfway between inside and outside, thanks to the sunlight passing through the lightweight roof, the breeze, the sounds of the birds flying through the upper reaches of the aisles and the sand floors. </p>

<p>The time that passed from the eviction of the tenants of this sixteenth-century palace and the commission to transform the building into a small hotel and restaurant resulted in an extremely suggestive and evocative intermediate landscape; somewhere between a ruin and a void, between existing conditions and archaeology, a window open onto history in which the marks of events and of our time are superimposed, like a palimpsest. It is an atlas of different undocumented materials, which registers the memories of the inhabitants and the history of the construction of the house and its transformations.<br />
The intermediate house is a place waiting for something to happen. An intervened space without intervention. It is the frozen memory of a place that at this moment is not inhabited.<br />
Containing the past, present and future simultaneously as a way to retain in memory this place and its origin.</p>

<p>Juan Domingo had decided that he would convert the old, abandoned factory near the train tracks into his architecture studio. A desire that became stronger with the passing years. The factory quickly became a field for study and experimentation where he learned the importance of addressing history and its meaning in a more natural, relaxed and less dramatic way. He reconstructed his history by letting intuition lead him and through a series of experiences which let him decipher this mysterious place, until he had made a map of singular events, from its foundation up to his arrival. He remembers having made outings to the site and naming different places, relating the original toponymy of the spaces with possible or desired future activities. With the passing years the revitalization project and the activities that have been implemented can be recognized as a rescue mission for this industrial complex. The short film ‘An encounter’, produced together with cinema director Juan Bollaín, relates his experiences in the factory.</p>

<p>This intervention interprets the building where the sixteenth-century convent is inserted, as a context that over the centuries is continually being transformed. Beyond a historical interest, the succession of alterations suggests a metamorphosis; the approach to the building emerges from the search for its materiality, concealed by the claddings of the old university classrooms.<br />
In this space that has been so dramatically altered, with an extremely limited budget, the project is activated by the action of discovery; converting destruction into something as natural as construction. After unmasking floors, walls and ceilings, the blurred openings between spaces were reinforced with steel jambs and lintels and new glazing was installed in the cloister to recover the transparent relation with the courtyard that existed when it was an ambulatory. The result is a rough intervention that doesn’t pretend to be conclusive, but offers an intermediate moment. From this point all options are possible; it is a space in an ellipsis, waiting expectantly for each artistic installation to complete it.</p>

<p>Acquired in 2004 in a state of ruin, over stages the old Barberí foundry has gradually become RCR Arquitectes’ studio. The past of this factory building, constructed at the beginning of the twentieth century, is evident everywhere and establishes a very close relationship with new interventions.<br />
The connection between tradition and innovation, together with other core concepts of the RCR philosophy like relating to the outdoors and reflecting the passage of time, has given rise to an ensemble that combines different spaces and uses.<br />
The renovation work, which has been under way since 2006, consolidated the former complex and reorganised the existing industrial buildings, transforming them into a laboratory that meets their studio’s various needs.</p>

<p>It was the notion of discovery that occurred with the Rei Marti water deposit, a former space for water storage of the Torre Bellesguard house in Barcelona, designed by Gaudi and located next to the viaduct that is also attributed to this totemic architect. This water deposit had been concealed beneath a pine forest until 20 years ago, when during some minor maintenance work on the small part of the old-growth forest that still remained; a truck began to sink into the ground. Quickly it was confirmed to the amazement of all that a huge space of more than 600 m2 was crouching under the earth. It was definitely decided to share the space, to invite the public to reclaim this stroke of luck, but, above all, share the emotion of the unexpected discovery. To this end the project had to be as faithful as possible to the space as it was originally encountered. The character, materiality, the force of a space with arches and vaults had to be valued, maintained and strengthened by the intervention.</p>

<p>After the former industrial shed was consolidated and suitably protected, and while construction still hadn’t started for the new MUHBA (Barcelona History Museum), it was decided that the complex would be opened to the public. First a minimum of strictly necessary construction had been carried out to protect the building from rain and wind: a new lightweight roof was built, supported on the existing structure, concrete paving was installed with an embedded raceway for future mechanical installation and the existing windows were protected with polycarbonate sheets. The objective of all the interventions was to affect as little as possible the interior atmosphere, in order to reflect the passage of time: the fire, the graffiti, etc. The design tried to define the intervention with a single gesture by proposing a huge lamp hung in the middle of the space, drawing a ring of light that separates the exterior perimeter, dedicated to housing a long term exhibition about the city of Barcelona, from the interior which is to house temporary exhibitions and presentations.</p>

<p>Renovation always implies establishing a certain relationship with the past, or with the pasts that are accumulated in the space of the intervention. This residential project for the members of an extended family has as its point of departure the recovery and renovation of a complex of derelict buildings constructed over the course of centuries in the historic centre of the city of Girona. The huge stone carcasses established an optimal relation to the place in climatic terms. The project tried to discover, maintain and revitalize the different forms of intelligence deposited in these spaces over time. In terms of materials, we were able to work with a valuable inheritance: the house itself provided grates, mosaic tile and stone that could be reused in the construction. The project casually reveals the overlapping of old and new layers, depending on the state of conservation of each element, and the future use of each space. And, above all, the growing confidence is a design system that is necessarily open (in this case the collage) capable of harmonically integrating into a whole all of the histories of each fragment of the process.</p>

<p>The Casa del Condestable is a sixteenth-century palace that had undergone sweeping renovations and alterations over the years, until finally the original building was unrecognizable and in a general state of ruin. The process of historical documentation, preparation of the design project and construction supervision of the building restoration and renovation lasted seven years. Original elements from the renaissance building were uncovered, including almost 4000 square meters of wood ceilings that had been hidden by suspended ceilings in the perimeter rooms. By removing the added ceilings and restoring the wood, these rooms recovered their original proportions and appearance. A major part of the architectural intervention centred around the recuperation of the central courtyard, of which only a few of the original columns remained. The project establishes a natural continuity between the old and the necessarily new, by using the original materials throughout: wood, terracotta, lime stuccoes and plaster.</p>

<p>The Casal Balaguer is a palace in the historic centre of Palma. It was a grand aristocratic house with its origins in the fourteenth-century, renovated in the sixteenth-century and enlarged in the eighteenth-century. At the end of the last century the City of Palma decided to convert the building into a cultural centre. The project signals a new era for the Casal, which will go from being a family home to a public building, open to the entire city. In the new program the ground floor contains the entry to the exhibition gallery and the cafeteria. The structural renovation on this floor made it possible to revert the courtyard to its the original condition, with a complete vision of the three arches that seem to support the suspended house. The main floor is dedicated to a museum about the house and the attic floor houses workshops for the fine arts circle and a lecture hall.</p>
